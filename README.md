# RayCastingGame
## Description
This is my realization of reycasting.
I used SFML library to render the picture.
## Game features
- As a player you can walk throug a randomly generated maze.
- When you find the exit, the maze is recreated with bigger size (two times and then it will have the constant size) and new layout.
- At this realization you can look not only horizontally, but also vertically.

## Future plans
- Rewrite code with a better structure and optimization if it is possible.
